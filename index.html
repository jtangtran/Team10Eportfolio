			<p>
				The CDP project is an online web application for collaborative community discussions regarding civic development and improvements. The application provides users with projects in various stages of development, such as the ideation, sponsorship, and active collaboration stage. On the platform, citizens are able to post ideas and support others’ ideas in hopes of improving their community. Furthermore, the project will open the current community development process to those who have traditionally not been involved or who have encountered barriers to accessing on-site meetings.
