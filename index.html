				The Community Discussion Platform is an online web application that allows patrons to discuss issues and problems and propose ideas and projects for their local community. 
				The application provides users with a list of projects in various stages of development, such as the idea stage, the sponsorship stage, and the active collaboration stage. 
				Users can rate these projects in accordance to how much they agree or disagree with their goals, comment on these projects to express their own opinions and viewpoints on the matter, and create new projects to address issues within their own community.
