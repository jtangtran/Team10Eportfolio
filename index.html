				project by Nicolas LeBlanc, Executive Director of MyLivingCity. The team consists of Phuong (Jennifer)
				Tang-Tran, Joshua Sivertson, and Changsin Park, and together they are called Team 10/10 because of their

						The CDP project is an online web application for collaborative community discussions regarding
						civic
						development and improvements. The application provides users with projects in various stages of
						development, such as the ideation, sponsorship, and active collaboration stage. On the platform,
						citizens are able to post ideas and support others’ ideas in hopes of improving their community.
						Furthermore, the project will open the current community development process to those who have
						traditionally not been involved or who have encountered barriers to accessing on-site meetings.
